Astrocalculator is a simple program to calculate astronomical ephemerides.

Dependencies :
Qt 4.8.0 and above 
AA+ v1.47 and above (http://www.naughter.com/aa.html)

You may find comments in the code refering to this book.

To Build:
>./getaaplus.bash
>make distclean
>qmake astrocalculator.pro
>make -j4
>make clean  # remove intermediate files but leaves app

Supported platforms:
- Ubuntu, Mac OS X
- Can be build for iOS, but fonts and GUI are wrong
- Can be build for win32 if you manually build aaplus and change '/' with '\\' in .pro file (not tested)
